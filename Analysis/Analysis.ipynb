year - old man presented with a progressively increasing swelling over the ventral aspect of the right wrist of 23 days duration following a laceration .\\nThe swelling was soft , pulsatile and was intermittently bleeding , with poor distal capillary filling and cold distal extremity .\\nClinically it was diagnosed as pseudoaneurysm of the radial artery and was sent for a duplex scan for confirmation .\\nThe lesion ruptured in the radiology department before the scan was done , and the patient went into hypovolaemia .\\nIn view of this , the patient underwent exploration of the pseudoaneurysm under brachial block , and the radial artery was found to be transected just proximal to the dorsal branch .\\nIt was decided to repair the artery as there was no evidence of adequate circulation supply or the patency of the ulnar artery preoperatively .\\nDoppler study at 15 and 45 days postoperatively showed good flow through , with no evidence of thrombus .\\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nPseudoaneurysms occur rarely in the radial artery .\\nAlmost all the cases reported to date have been secondary to radial artery cannulation or puncture for various indications .\\nThere have been very few reported cases of spontaneous rupture of false aneurysm of the radial artery .\\nWe report a case of a pseudoaneurysm of the radial artery occurring secondary to a laceration over the right wrist sustained while working in the garden ; the pseudoaneurysm ruptured spontaneously .\\nFalse aneurysm of the radial artery , other than that due to a direct iatrogenic puncture or associated with fracture of bones , is not thought to have been reported in the literature .\\nSpontaneous rupture of these lesions has been reported extremely rarely in the literature .\\n\\nCASE PRESENTATION\\n\\nA 40 - year - old man presented to us with a history of a soft , expanding , pulsatile mass over the right wrist , of 23 days duration .\\nHe had suffered from laceration over the wrist around a month earlier , and this had been sutured at a peripheral hospital .\\nHe noticed the swelling around a week later and it continued to increase in size , with progressive difficulty in extension of the wrist .\\nHe started to bleed from the lesion intermittently after the sutures were removed .\\nHe consulted the local hospital and was treated conservatively .\\nAt this time he decided to come to us .\\n\\nOn examination , a soft , globular , pulsatile mass of 5 × 4 cm ( fig 1 ) with eroded skin in some areas was noted over the right wrist on the ventral aspect .\\nThe wrist was in a slightly flexed and ulnar deviated position .\\nA “ T ” shaped scar with suture marks could also be made out .\\nProximal pressure over the radial artery made the swelling non-pulsatile .\\nUlnar artery pulsation could not be felt .\\nCapillary filling time was sluggish in right finger tips in comparison with the left , and the hand felt cold even though finger movements were present .\\nA provisional diagnosis of false aneurysm of the radial artery was made and the patient was sent to the radiology department for a duplex scan .\\n\\nThe false aneurysm ruptured in the radiology department before a duplex scan could be performed , and the patient went into hypovolaemia due to bleeding .\\nWe decided to operate and explore in view of the rupture , without the duplex scan report ( fig 2 ) .\\n\\nTREATMENT\\n\\nExploration was done under brachial block with back - up for general anaesthesia , with a pneumatic tourniquet .\\nThe proximal radial artery was exposed by vertical incision over the lower part of forearm , and skeletonised .\\nThe artery distal to the aneurysm was also exposed and skeletonised .\\nThe aneurysm sac was excised and clots removed , and this revealed transaction of the radial artery just proximal to the dorsal branch at the wrist .\\nProfuse bleeding was noted from both ends on release of the tourniquet .\\nProximal and distal vascular control was achieved by bulldog vascular clamps after heparinising both ends of the transected artery .\\nThe radial artery was repaired using 6 / 0 prolene with interrupted sutures , and flow was restored on release of the bulldog vascular clamps ( fig 3 ) .\\nThe skin was repaired with interrupted 1 / 0 prolene sutures .\\nThe aneurysm sac was sent for culture and sensitivity .\\n\\nOUTCOME AND FOLLOW - UP\\n\\nThe patient was continued on heparin injections for 2 days postoperatively , and discharged on oral warfarin on the fifth postoperative day ( POD ) . Sutures were removed on 10th POD .\\nA Doppler study on 15th POD showed weak flow through the anastomosis and a patent small ulnar artery .\\nThe capillary filling improved and the temperature of both hands was equal .\\nWrist and finger movements were pain free without any restrictions .\\nRepeat Doppler study at 2 weeks and at 1.5 month follow - up showed good flow through the radial artery and maintenance of patency .\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nA false aneurysm is usually described as a pulsating haematoma that communicates with an artery through a disruption in the arterial wall .\\nThere is no fixed definition but false aneurysms are irreversible and at least 50 % larger than the normal arterial diameter .\\n1 The radial artery is most affected at the distal part where it lies superficially .\\nTraumatic pseudoaneurysms may occur acutely or , more commonly , they may be discovered following unrecognised arterial injury .\\nMany false aneurysms of the radial artery have been reported recently and most often they are localised in an area of arterial puncture or cannulation .\\nOne - third of cases in a series presented with rupture requiring urgent opertion .\\nControversy exists regarding the treatment alternatives for pseudoaneurysm of radial artery , and reconstruction with interposition graft has been advocated .\\nLigation of the artery is an alternative to end - to - end anastomosis in situations where there is a dual root of supply ( eg , in wrist and leg ) , demonstration of good collaterals in angiography , and excellent back bleeding from distal stump .\\n6 A compression bandage , especially for children , offers an alternative to surgical procedure .\\nPseudoaneurysms less than 2 cm in diameter have a 70 % likelihood of spontaneous thrombosis with compression therapy , whereas larger ones and those in anticoagulated patients are likely to persist .\\nPercutaneous thrombin injection has become an effective and alternative treatment option since the last decade .\\nRadial artery pseudoaneurysm can also occur following missed traumatic lacerations other than iatrogenic arterial puncture .\\nWe decided to reconstruct the artery by achieving end - to - end anastomosis , as distal vascularity was jeopardised and we did not have documentary evidence of circulation through the ulnar artery .\\nWe believe that reconstruction should be attempted , especially in situations where distal vascularity is in doubt , even in areas where there are dual roots of circulation and adequate back bleeding from the distal stump

BEG__progressively increasing swelling__END over the ventral aspect of the right wrist of 23 days duration following a BEG__laceration__END .\\nThe BEG__swelling__END was soft , pulsatile and was BEG__intermittently bleeding__END , with BEG__poor distal capillary filling__END and BEG__cold distal extremity__END .\\nClinically it was diagnosed as BEG__pseudoaneurysm of the radial artery__END and was sent for a BEG__duplex scan__END for confirmation .\\nThe BEG__lesion ruptured__END in the radiology department before the BEG__scan__END was done , and the patient went into BEG__hypovolaemia__END .\\nIn view of this , the patient underwent BEG__exploration__END of the BEG__pseudoaneurysm under brachial block__END , and the radial artery was found to be transected just proximal to the dorsal branch .\\nIt was decided to repair the artery as there was no evidence of adequate circulation supply or the patency of the ulnar artery preoperatively .\\nBEG__Doppler study__END at 15 and 45 days postoperatively showed good flow through , with no evidence of BEG__thrombus__END .\\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nBEG__Pseudoaneurysms occur rarely in the radial artery__END .\\nAlmost all the cases reported to date have been secondary to BEG__radial artery cannulation__END or BEG__puncture__END for various indications .\\nThere have been very few reported cases of BEG__spontaneous rupture of false aneurysm of the radial artery__END .\\nWe report a case of a BEG__pseudoaneurysm of the radial artery__END occurring secondary to a BEG__laceration over the right wrist__END sustained while working in the garden ; the BEG__pseudoaneurysm__END ruptured spontaneously .\\nBEG__False aneurysm of the radial artery__END , other than that due to a BEG__direct iatrogenic puncture__END or associated with BEG__fracture of bones__END , is not thought to have been reported in the literature .\\nBEG__Spontaneous rupture of these lesions__END has been reported extremely rarely in the literature .\\n\\nCASE PRESENTATION\\n\\nA 40 - year - old man presented to us with a history of a soft , expanding , BEG__pulsatile mass over the right wrist__END , of 23 days duration .\\nHe had suffered from BEG__laceration over the wrist__END around a month earlier , and this had been sutured at a peripheral hospital .\\nHe noticed the BEG__swelling__END around a week later and it continued to increase in size , with BEG__progressive difficulty in extension of the wrist__END .\\nHe started to BEG__bleed from the lesion__END intermittently after the BEG__sutures__END were removed .\\nHe consulted the local hospital and was treated conservatively .\\nAt this time he decided to come to us .\\n\\nOn BEG__examination__END , a soft , globular , BEG__pulsatile mass__END of 5 × 4 cm ( fig 1 ) with BEG__eroded skin__END in some areas was noted over the right wrist on the ventral aspect .\\nThe wrist was in a slightly flexed and ulnar deviated position .\\nA “ T ” BEG__shaped scar__END with BEG__suture marks__END could also be made out .\\nBEG__Proximal pressure__END over the radial artery made the BEG__swelling non-pulsatile__END .\\nBEG__Ulnar artery pulsation__END could not be felt .\\nBEG__Capillary filling time__END was BEG__sluggish in right finger tips__END in comparison with the left , and the hand felt BEG__cold__END even though finger movements were present .\\nA provisional diagnosis of BEG__false aneurysm of the radial artery__END was made and the patient was sent to the radiology department for a BEG__duplex scan__END .\\n\\nThe BEG__false aneurysm__END ruptured in the radiology department before a BEG__duplex scan__END could be performed , and the patient went into BEG__hypovolaemia__END due to BEG__bleeding__END .\\nWe decided to operate and explore in view of the BEG__rupture__END , without the BEG__duplex scan__END report ( fig 2 ) .\\n\\nBEG__TREATMENT__END\\n\\nBEG__Exploration__END was done under brachial block with back - up for general anaesthesia , with a BEG__pneumatic tourniquet__END .\\nThe proximal radial artery was exposed by BEG__vertical incision over the lower part of forearm__END , and skeletonised .\\nThe artery distal to the BEG__aneurysm__END was also exposed and skeletonised .\\nThe BEG__aneurysm sac__END was excised and BEG__clots__END removed , and this revealed transaction of the radial artery just proximal to the dorsal branch at the wrist .\\nBEG__Profuse bleeding__END was noted from both ends on release of the tourniquet .\\nProximal and distal vascular control was achieved by bulldog vascular clamps after heparinising both ends of the transected artery .\\nThe radial artery was repaired using 6 / 0 prolene with BEG__interrupted sutures__END , and flow was restored on BEG__release of the bulldog vascular clamps__END ( fig 3 ) .\\nThe skin was repaired with interrupted 1 / 0 BEG__prolene sutures__END .\\nThe BEG__aneurysm sac__END was sent for BEG__culture and sensitivity__END .\\n\\nOUTCOME AND FOLLOW - UP\\n\\nThe patient was continued on BEG__heparin injections__END for 2 days postoperatively , and discharged on BEG__oral warfarin__END on the fifth postoperative day ( POD ) . BEG__Sutures__END were removed on 10th POD .\\nA BEG__Doppler study__END on 15th POD showed BEG__weak flow through the anastomosis__END and a BEG__patent small ulnar artery__END .\\nThe BEG__capillary filling__END improved and the BEG__temperature__END of both hands was equal .\\nWrist and finger movements were BEG__pain__END free without any restrictions .\\nBEG__Repeat Doppler study__END at 2 weeks and at 1.5 month follow - up showed good flow through the radial artery and maintenance of patency .\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nA BEG__false aneurysm__END is usually described as a BEG__pulsating haematoma__END that communicates with an artery through a BEG__disruption in the arterial wall__END .\\nThere is no BEG__fixed definition but false aneurysms__END are irreversible and at least 50 % larger than the normal arterial diameter .\\n1 The radial artery is most affected at the distal part where it lies superficially .\\nBEG__Traumatic pseudoaneurysms__END may occur acutely or , more commonly , they may be discovered following BEG__unrecognised arterial injury .\\nMany false aneurysms of the radial artery__END have been reported recently and most often they are localised in an area of BEG__arterial puncture__END or BEG__cannulation__END .\\nOne -

year - old man presented to us with a history of a soft , expanding , BEG__pulsatile mass over the right wrist__END , of 23 days duration .\\nHe had suffered from BEG__laceration over the wrist__END around a month earlier , and this had been sutured at a peripheral hospital .\\nHe noticed the BEG__swelling__END around a week later and it continued to increase in size , with BEG__progressive difficulty in extension of the wrist__END .\\nHe started to BEG__bleed from the lesion__END intermittently after the BEG__sutures__END were removed .\\nHe consulted the local hospital and was treated conservatively .\\nAt this time he decided to come to us .\\n\\nOn BEG__examination__END , a soft , globular , BEG__pulsatile mass__END of 5 × 4 cm ( fig 1 ) with BEG__eroded skin__END in some areas was noted over the right wrist on the ventral aspect .\\nThe wrist was in a slightly flexed and ulnar deviated position .\\nA “ T ” BEG__shaped scar__END with BEG__suture marks__END could also be made out .\\nBEG__Proximal pressure__END over the radial artery made the BEG__swelling non-pulsatile__END .\\nBEG__Ulnar artery pulsation__END could not be felt .\\nBEG__Capillary filling time__END was BEG__sluggish in right finger tips__END in comparison with the left , and the hand felt BEG__cold__END even though finger movements were present .\\nA provisional diagnosis of BEG__false aneurysm of the radial artery__END was made and the patient was sent to the radiology department for a BEG__duplex scan__END .\\n\\nThe BEG__false aneurysm__END ruptured in the radiology department before a BEG__duplex scan__END could be performed , and the patient went into BEG__hypovolaemia__END due to BEG__bleeding__END .\\nWe decided to operate and explore in view of the BEG__rupture__END , without the BEG__duplex scan__END report ( fig 2 ) .\\n\\nBEG__TREATMENT__END\\n\\nBEG__Exploration__END was done under brachial block with back - up for general anaesthesia , with a BEG__pneumatic tourniquet__END .\\nThe proximal radial artery was exposed by BEG__vertical incision over the lower part of forearm__END , and skeletonised .\\nThe artery distal to the BEG__aneurysm__END was also exposed and skeletonised .\\nThe BEG__aneurysm sac__END was excised and BEG__clots__END removed , and this revealed transaction of the radial artery just proximal to the dorsal branch at the wrist .\\nBEG__Profuse bleeding__END was noted from both ends on release of the tourniquet .\\nProximal and distal vascular control was achieved by bulldog vascular clamps after heparinising both ends of the transected artery .\\nThe radial artery was repaired using 6 / 0 prolene with BEG__interrupted sutures__END , and flow was restored on BEG__release of the bulldog vascular clamps__END ( fig 3 ) .\\nThe skin was repaired with interrupted 1 / 0 BEG__prolene sutures__END .\\nThe BEG__aneurysm sac__END was sent for BEG__culture and sensitivity__END .\\n\\nOUTCOME AND FOLLOW - UP\\n\\nThe patient was continued on BEG__heparin injections__END for 2 days postoperatively , and discharged on BEG__oral warfarin__END on the fifth postoperative day ( POD ) . BEG__Sutures__END were removed on 10th POD .\\nA BEG__Doppler study__END on 15th POD showed BEG__weak flow through the anastomosis__END and a BEG__patent small ulnar artery__END .\\nThe BEG__capillary filling__END improved and the BEG__temperature__END of both hands was equal .\\nWrist and finger movements were BEG__pain__END free without any restrictions .\\nBEG__Repeat Doppler study__END at 2 weeks and at 1.5 month follow - up showed good flow through the radial artery and maintenance of patency .\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nA BEG__false aneurysm__END is usually described as a BEG__pulsating haematoma__END that communicates with an artery through a BEG__disruption in the arterial wall__END .\\nThere is no BEG__fixed definition but false aneurysms__END are irreversible and at least 50 % larger than the normal arterial diameter .\\n1 The radial artery is most affected at the distal part where it lies superficially .\\nBEG__Traumatic pseudoaneurysms__END may occur acutely or , more commonly , they may be discovered following BEG__unrecognised arterial injury .\\nMany false aneurysms of the radial artery__END have been reported recently and most often they are localised in an area of BEG__arterial puncture__END or BEG__cannulation__END .\\nOne - third of cases in a BEG__series__END presented with BEG__rupture__END requiring urgent opertion .\\nControversy exists regarding the BEG__treatment alternatives__END for BEG__pseudoaneurysm of radial artery__END , and BEG__reconstruction__END with BEG__interposition graft__END has been advocated .\\nBEG__Ligation__END of the artery is an alternative to BEG__end - to - end anastomosis__END in situations where there is a dual root of supply ( eg , in wrist and leg ) , demonstration of good collaterals in BEG__angiography__END , and excellent back BEG__bleeding from distal stump__END .\\n6 A BEG__compression bandage__END , especially for children , offers an alternative to BEG__surgical procedure__END .\\nBEG__Pseudoaneurysms__END less than 2 cm in diameter have a 70 % likelihood of BEG__spontaneous thrombosis__END with BEG__compression therapy__END , whereas larger ones and those in anticoagulated patients are likely to persist .\\nBEG__Percutaneous thrombin injection__END has become an effective and alternative treatment option since the last decade .\\nBEG__Radial artery pseudoaneurysm__END can also occur following missed BEG__traumatic lacerations__END other than BEG__iatrogenic arterial puncture__END .\\nWe decided to reconstruct the artery by achieving BEG__end - to - end anastomosis__END , as distal vascularity was jeopardised and we did not have BEG__documentary evidence of circulation through the ulnar artery__END .\\nWe believe that BEG__reconstruction__END should be attempted , especially in situations where distal vascularity is in doubt , even in areas where there are BEG__dual roots of circulation and adequate back bleeding from the distal stump__END .'"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"UjDRbnI_dmn3","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["file = 'CSE576/data/Output_updated/bert_dev.json'\n","with jsonlines.open(file, 'r') as f:\n","    data = f.read()\n","\n","file = \"CSE576/data/Output_updated/gold_answers_dev_clicr.txt\"\n","f = open(file, 'w')\n","count = 0"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"CaaNdBGuml0g","colab_type":"code","outputId":"b429ea03-b902-45c4-dd77-45e6fa3fe84f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1584824982469,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":313,"user":{"displayName":"Aditya Krishna Sai Pulikonda","photoUrl":"","userId":"15441039384927740998"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["for _doc in range(0, len(data['data'])):\n","  doc = data['data'][_doc]['document']\n","  #_context = doc['context']\n","  _qas = doc['qas']\n","\n","  for _qa in _qas:\n","    count = count + 1\n","    f.write(_qa['id'])\n","    f.write('\\t')\n","    f.write( _qa['answers']['text'])\n","    f.write('\\n')\n","\n","    if(count == 500) : break\n","  if(count == 500): break\n","\n","f.close()\n","f = open(file,'r')\n","len(f.readlines())\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["500"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":40}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HtGSIKrYWuhf","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
