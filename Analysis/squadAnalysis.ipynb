Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.\",\n","  'qas': [{'answers': [{'answer_start': 291, 'text': 'Gary Kubiak'},\n","     {'answer_start': 291, 'text': 'Gary Kubiak'},\n","     {'answer_start': 332, 'text': 'Kubiak'}],\n","    'id': '56beb4e43aeaaa14008c9265',\n","    'question': 'Who is the head coach of the Broncos?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 1157, 'text': 'Brock Osweiler'},\n","     {'answer_start': 1157, 'text': 'Brock Osweiler'},\n","     {'answer_start': 1163, 'text': 'Osweiler'}],\n","    'id': '56beb4e43aeaaa14008c9266',\n","    'question': 'Who played quarterback for the Broncos after Peyton Manning was benched?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 641, 'text': 'Indianapolis Colts'},\n","     {'answer_start': 637, 'text': 'the Indianapolis Colts'},\n","     {'answer_start': 654, 'text': 'Colts'}],\n","    'id': '56beb4e43aeaaa14008c9267',\n","    'question': 'Who did Peyton Manning play for as a rookie?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 1404, 'text': 'San Diego Chargers'},\n","     {'answer_start': 1404, 'text': 'San Diego Chargers'},\n","     {'answer_start': 1414, 'text': 'Chargers'}],\n","    'id': '56beb4e43aeaaa14008c9268',\n","    'question': 'Who did the Broncos play in the last week of the regular season?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 1640, 'text': 'Wade Phillips'},\n","     {'answer_start': 1640, 'text': 'Wade Phillips'},\n","     {'answer_start': 1645, 'text': 'Phillips'}],\n","    'id': '56beb4e43aeaaa14008c9269',\n","    'question': \"Who is Denver's defensive coordinator?\"},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 201, 'text': 'four'},\n","     {'answer_start': 238, 'text': 'four'},\n","     {'answer_start': 238, 'text': 'four'}],\n","    'id': '56bf301c3aeaaa14008c954d',\n","    'question': 'How many years was John Fox the head coach of the Denver Broncos?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 291, 'text': 'Gary Kubiak'},\n","     {'answer_start': 291, 'text': 'Gary Kubiak'},\n","     {'answer_start': 332, 'text': 'Kubiak'}],\n","    'id': '56bf301c3aeaaa14008c954e',\n","    'question': \"What is the name of the Bronco's head coach, who was hired after John Fox?

The Broncos' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks. Jordan Norwood's 61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down, while Carolina was barely better at 3-of-15. The two teams' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was a Super Bowl low. Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, and the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl with two different teams, while Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player.\",\n","  'qas': [{'answers': [{'answer_start': 136, 'text': '194'},\n","     {'answer_start': 136, 'text': '194'},\n","     {'answer_start': 136, 'text': '194'}],\n","    'id': '56becb823aeaaa14008c948b',\n","    'question': 'How many total yards did Denver gain?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 164, 'text': '11'},\n","     {'answer_start': 164, 'text': '11'},\n","     {'answer_start': 164, 'text': '11'}],\n","    'id': '56becb823aeaaa14008c948c',\n","    'question': 'How many first downs did Denver have?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 308, 'text': 'Baltimore Ravens'},\n","     {'answer_start': 304, 'text': 'the Baltimore Ravens'},\n","     {'answer_start': 318, 'text': 'Ravens'}],\n","    'id': '56becb823aeaaa14008c948d',\n","    'question': 'What team had 244 yards in Super Bowl XXXV?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 593, 'text': 'Jordan Norwood'},\n","     {'answer_start': 593, 'text': 'Jordan Norwood'},\n","     {'answer_start': 600, 'text': 'Norwood'}],\n","    'id': '56becb823aeaaa14008c948e',\n","    'question': 'Who returned a punt for 61 yards, setting a new Super Bowl record?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 897, 'text': 'Manning'},\n","     {'answer_start': 1069, 'text': 'Manning'},\n","     {'answer_start': 1069, 'text': 'Manning'}],\n","    'id': '56becb823aeaaa14008c948f',\n","    'question': 'Who is the only quarterback to win a Super Bowl with two teams?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 136, 'text': '194'},\n","     {'answer_start': 136, 'text': '194'},\n","     {'answer_start': 136, 'text': '194'}],\n","    'id': '56d7277c0d65d214001983fe',\n","    'question': 'How many yards did Denver have for Super Bowl 50?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 164, 'text': '11'},\n","     {'answer_start': 164, 'text': '11'},\n","     {'answer_start': 164, 'text': '11'}],\n","    'id': '56d7277c0d65d214001983ff',\n","    'question': 'How many first downs did Denver have for Super Bowl 50?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 508, 'text': 'Chicago Bears'},\n","     {'answer_start': 504, 'text': 'the Chicago Bears'},\n","     {'answer_start': 516, 'text': 'Bears'}],\n","    'id': '56d7277c0d65d21400198401',\n","    'question': 'Who did the Broncos tie with the most sacks in a Super Bowl?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 451, 'text': 'Broncos'},\n","     {'answer_start': 726, 'text': 'Denver'},\n","     {'answer_start': 68, 'text': 'Denver'}],\n","    'id': '56d7277c0d65d21400198402',\n","    'question': 'Which team did Gary Kubiak play for when he was in the Super Bowl?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 158, 'text': '21'},\n","     {'answer_start': 158, 'text': '21'},\n","     {'answer_start': 158, 'text': '21'}],\n","    'id': '56d9cd9adc89441400fdb84c',\n","    'question': 'How many first downs did the Panthers have in Super Bowl 50?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 164, 'text': '11'},\n","     {'answer_start': 164, 'text': '11'},\n","     {'answer_start': 164, 'text': '11'}],\n","    'id': '56d9cd9adc89441400fdb84d',\n","    'question': 'How many first downs did the Broncos have in Super Bowl 50?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 447, 'text': 'The Broncos'},\n","     {'answer_start': 68, 'text': 'Denver'},\n","     {'answer_start': 68, 'text': 'Denver'}],\n","    'id': '56d9cd9adc89441400fdb84e',\n","    'question': 'What team had the lowest downs and yards ever in the Super Bowl as of Super Bowl 50?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 508, 'text': 'Chicago Bears'},\n","     {'answer_start': 504, 'text': 'the Chicago Bears'},\n","     {'answer_start': 516, 'text': 'Bears'}],\n","    'id': '56d9cd9adc89441400fdb84f',\n","    'question': 'What team di the Broncos tie a Super Bowl record for in sacks?'},\n","   {'answers': [{'answer_start': 814, 'text': 'two'},\n","     {'answer_start': 1199, 'text': 'two'},\n","     {'answer_start': 1199, 'text': 'two'}],\n","    'id': '56d9cd9adc89441400fdb850',\n","    'question': 'How many teams has Manning won the Super Bowl with?'}]}]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":22}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"iV4GkW4xBfHg","colab_type":"code","outputId":"f449b2b5-a73c-4a52-b00c-6b379792cc90","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1584818997556,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":501,"user":{"displayName":"Aditya Krishna Sai Pulikonda","photoUrl":"","userId":"15441039384927740998"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["      #
